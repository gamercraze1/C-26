Take 2 to 2.25 cups whole wheat flour, ½ tsp salt, 1 tsp ghee or oil in a mixing bowl
Pour about ½ cup of water.
mix and begin to knead. add more water if required and knead to a smooth soft dough.
Cover and allow the dough to rest for 20 to 30 minutes.
Meanwhile while the dough is resting, prepare the stuffing. Grate 200 grams of paneer.
Add 1 or 2 finely chopped green chilies, ½ tsp dry mango powder, ½ tsp garam masala powder, ½ tsp red chili powder and ½ tsp salt. You can add more salt, red chili powder or dry mango powder if you prefer.
Mix everything well so that the spice powders are uniformly mixed with the grated paneer.
Pinch two small balls from the dough and roll them in your palms to make them even.
Dust some flour on the dough balls.
With a rolling pin, roll the dough balls to a circle of about 4 to 5 inches in diameter.
Place the paneer stuffing on one of the rolled rounds keeping one-inch space around the circumference.
Cover with the other rolled dough and press the edges well.
Sprinkle some flour and roll the stuffed paratha to a circle of about 6 to 7 inches in diameter.Heat a tava/griddle and then place the rolled paratha on it. The tava should be hot. To check the heat, sprinkle a generous pinch of whole wheat flour on the tawa. If the whole wheat flour becomes brown in some seconds, the tawa is hot enough to roast the paneer paratha.
Flip when one side is partly cooked. About ¼ cooked.
Apply ghee or oil on this side with a spoon.
Turn over and flip.
Let the side in which we applied ghee get cooked now.
Spread some ghee on the top.
Flip again.
Press the edges of paratha with a spatula so that the edges are cooked.
Flip once or twice till the paratha has golden spots and is evenly cooked.
Place the paneer paratha in a roti basket or casserole.
Spread the butter on the paratha.
